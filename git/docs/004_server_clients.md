# 🔁 Git Server vs Git Client

> [!TIP]
> A **Git client** is any machine or software environment where Git is installed and used to **interact with repositories**. <br/> A **Git server** is a machine or service that **hosts Git** repositories and allows **other machines (Git clients) to interact with them**.
